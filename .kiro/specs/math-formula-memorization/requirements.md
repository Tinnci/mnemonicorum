# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a math formula memorization app that helps users learn and practice mathematical formulas through interactive exercises. The app will present formulas in a gamified way similar to Duolingo, where users match formula parts, complete missing components, and practice recognition through various exercise types.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student, I want to practice mathematical formulas through interactive matching exercises, so that I can memorize formulas more effectively than traditional rote learning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts a practice session THEN the system SHALL display a formula component (left side, right side, or partial formula)
2. WHEN a formula component is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide multiple choice options for the matching part
3. WHEN the user selects an answer THEN the system SHALL immediately indicate if the answer is correct or incorrect
4. WHEN the user answers correctly THEN the system SHALL display positive feedback and move to the next question
5. WHEN the user answers incorrectly THEN the system SHALL show the correct answer and provide explanation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want to see mathematical formulas rendered properly with LaTeX formatting, so that complex mathematical expressions are displayed clearly and accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mathematical formulas are displayed THEN the system SHALL render them using proper LaTeX formatting
2. WHEN formulas contain fractions, integrals, or complex expressions THEN the system SHALL display them with correct mathematical notation
3. WHEN formulas are rendered THEN the system SHALL ensure they are readable on different screen sizes
4. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL preload mathematical fonts to avoid rendering delays

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student, I want to practice different types of mathematical formulas organized by categories, so that I can focus on specific areas of mathematics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the app THEN the system SHALL display available formula categories (e.g., Calculus, Algebra, Trigonometry)
2. WHEN the user selects a category THEN the system SHALL show available formula sets within that category
3. WHEN a formula set is selected THEN the system SHALL begin practice session with formulas from that set
4. WHEN practicing THEN the system SHALL include common formulas like Taylor series, trigonometric identities, and integration rules

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student, I want to track my progress and see which formulas I've mastered, so that I can focus my study time on areas that need improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user completes practice questions THEN the system SHALL record accuracy for each formula
2. WHEN the user views progress THEN the system SHALL display mastery level for each practiced formula
3. WHEN a formula is answered correctly multiple times THEN the system SHALL mark it as "mastered"
4. WHEN the user struggles with a formula THEN the system SHALL prioritize it in future practice sessions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student, I want different types of exercises beyond just matching, so that I can practice formulas in various ways to reinforce learning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN practicing THEN the system SHALL offer matching exercises (left side to right side)
2. WHEN practicing THEN the system SHALL offer completion exercises (fill in missing parts)
3. WHEN practicing THEN the system SHALL offer recognition exercises (identify the correct formula name)
4. WHEN an exercise type is selected THEN the system SHALL adapt the interface appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a student, I want the app to work offline, so that I can practice formulas without requiring an internet connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is installed THEN the system SHALL include all formula data locally
2. WHEN mathematical formulas are rendered THEN the system SHALL use offline LaTeX rendering without WebView dependencies
3. WHEN the user opens the app without internet THEN the system SHALL function normally for all core features
4. WHEN progress is tracked THEN the system SHALL store data locally on the device

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a student, I want smooth and responsive interactions when selecting answers, so that the learning experience feels engaging and immediate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps an answer option THEN the system SHALL respond within 100ms
2. WHEN formulas are displayed in lists or grids THEN the system SHALL scroll smoothly without lag
3. WHEN transitioning between questions THEN the system SHALL use smooth animations
4. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL load the main interface within 2 seconds
